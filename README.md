## Aim:
To design a distinctive and memorable logo that visually represents the brand's core identity of serenity and balance. The design will utilize a cohesive color palette and iconography to create a calming and professional aesthetic. This logo will serve as the central visual anchor for all web and mobile layouts, ensuring strong brand recognition.

## Algorithm :
***Grouping:***
Put related information close together (e.g., a class name and its time).

***Similarity:***
Make things that do the same job look the same (e.g., all buttons have the same style).

***Flow:***
Design the page to guide the user's eye smoothly from one section to the next.


***Web:***
Use a big main image (hero section), a clear menu at the top, and a grid of cards to show different yoga classes.

***Mobile:*** 
Use a simple menu icon (hamburger menu), a scrollable list for the schedule, and cards to show class details.

***Feel:*** 
Make buttons change color or look different when you click on them.

***Consistency:***
Use the same style and behavior for everything across the site.

***Easy to Use:***
Make sure important information like class schedules and booking buttons are easy to find.

***The Logo:***
The provided logo is perfect for the brand.

It's calming, balanced, and professional, using peaceful colors and a clear design.

This logo will be the main visual part of all the layouts to make the brand recognizable.
